The most common environment stages for deploying an application using CI/CD are:

1. **Development environment**: This is where developers work on the code and test their changes locally before committing them to the code repository.

2. **Continuous Integration (CI) environment**: Once code changes are committed to the repository, they are automatically built and tested in a CI environment. This helps to catch any errors or conflicts early in the development process.

3. **Quality Assurance (QA) environment**: Once the code has passed the CI environment, it is then deployed to a QA environment where it undergoes further testing and validation. This environment is typically a replica of the production environment.

4. **Staging environment**: After the code has passed QA, it is then deployed to a staging environment. This environment is also a replica of the production environment and allows for final user acceptance testing (UAT) and last-minute bug fixes.

5. **Production environment**: Finally, the code is deployed to the production environment where it is made available to end-users. This environment typically has stricter security controls and monitoring in place to ensure high availability and performance.

By following this deployment pipeline, developers can ensure that code changes are thoroughly tested and validated before being deployed to production, resulting in higher quality software and reduced risk of downtime or errors in production.
